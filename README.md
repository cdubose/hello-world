# hello-world
For science... computer science.

I'm Cici. I like functional programming, philosophy, apple juice, and the occasional cigar. Racket has captured my attention recently, but I am hoping to master OCaml and assembly as well as Racket in the future. In the non-programming world I am currently attending technical college to learn drafting, but hopefully if I do this programming thing right maybe one day I'll be a programmer (among other things).

I think it would be cool if there was a Dollar Bleed Club that sent women tampons every month for a few dollars. Someone please get on this.

I do not have very much here yet--I'm a little shy with these sorts of sites--but check back in a few weeks to see some programming in action.
