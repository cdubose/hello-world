# hello-world
For science... computer science.

I'm Cici. I like apple juice, programming, philosophy, and more apple juice. I am currently attending technical college to learn drafting, but hopefully if I do this programming thing right maybe one day I can call myself a real programmer.

I think it would be cool if there was a Dollar Bleed Club that sent women tampons every month for a few dollars. Someone please get on this.

This is my GitHub page. I do not have very much here yet--I'm a little shy with these sorts of sites--but check back in a few weeks to see some programming in action.
